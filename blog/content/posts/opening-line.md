So it begins, our journey reimaginig a work from the early 19th Century into a
21st Century form.

I like literature, but I'm no expert by any means, so that's my humble attempt
at an opening line.

The idea behind this blog is to write updates about the progress we make on the
project. Maybe more than a blog it should be called a _journal_. Entries can be
lengthy, short, technical, philosophical, art-related, books-related... Anything
Agustina or I deem interesting enough to write about, will be written about!

So you might wonder what are we actually doing? Well, while reading an
[article from Open Culture](http://www.openculture.com/2018/02/werners-nomenclature-of-colour-the-19th-century-color-dictionary-used-by-charles-darwin-1814.html) about _"Werner’s Nomenclature of Colours"_ geting a reprint,
I instantly thought about recreating that work as a modern day web app. My
inner steampunk nerd couldn't picture anything more awesome than having in his
smartphone the same book Darwin used on his journeys, but reshaped in a form
easy to use and explore in this digital age. Luckily enough, the book is in
public domain, being published over two centuries ago!
