        <p><em>So it begins, our journey reimaginig a work from the early 19th Century into a
21st Century form.</em></p>

<p>I like literature, but I&rsquo;m no expert by any means, so that&rsquo;s my humble attempt
at an opening line.</p>

<p>The idea behind this blog is to write updates about the progress we make on the
project. Maybe more than a blog it should be called a <em>journal</em>. Entries can be
lengthy, short, technical, philosophical, art-related, books-related&hellip; Anything
Agustina or I deem interesting enough to write about, will be written about!</p>

<p>So you might wonder what are we actually doing? Well, while reading an
<a href="http://www.openculture.com/2018/02/werners-nomenclature-of-colour-the-19th-century-color-dictionary-used-by-charles-darwin-1814.html">article from Open Culture</a> about <em>&ldquo;Werner’s Nomenclature of Colours&rdquo;</em> geting a reprint,
I instantly thought about recreating that work as a modern day web app. My
inner steampunk nerd couldn&rsquo;t picture anything more awesome than having in his
smartphone the same book Darwin used on his journeys, but reshaped in a form
easy to use and explore in this digital age. Luckily enough, the book is in
public domain, being published over two centuries ago!</p>
